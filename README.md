# Pattern Recognition â€” University Project

This repository contains a collection of exercises and mini-projects developed as part of a university course on **Pattern Recognition**. The focus is on understanding classification and clustering techniques through practical implementations.

## Topics Covered

### Hand Sign Recognition (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
- RGB image preprocessing and feature engineering
- Custom feature extraction for classification 
- Applied classifiers to distinguish between hand gestures

### Classification Algorithms
- **Bayes Classifier**  
  - Implemented using multivariate normal distributions  
  - Classifier performance evaluated via confusion matrix  

- **Neyman-Pearson Classifier**  
  - Decision-theoretic approach based on likelihood ratio testing  

- **Linear Classifiers**  
  - Implementation of linear decision boundaries  
  - Visualization and comparison with Bayes optimal solutions  

### Clustering Methods
- **C-means **  
  - Evaluation using visual inspection  

- **Maximum Likelihood Clustering**  
  - Clustering based on estimated parameters of Gaussian mixtures  
  - Unsupervised class separation with likelihood maximization

## Learning Goals

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with both **supervised** and **unsupervised** pattern recognition techniques. I explored how different classifiers and clustering methods behave under various conditions, and how to preprocess image data for classification tasks.
